# The-game_Furry-collects-coins
The goal is to write a simple Javascript game.  The hero of our game is Furry, who moves around the board with the size of 10x10 fields.  There is a coin on the random field of the board. The player controlling Furrym with the help of the arrows on the keyboard has to come to the coin. When he does, the coin disappears from the board and appears on a different field, also random, and the player gets 1 point.  When the player hits the wall, the game ends: the board disappears and, as in computer games, the word "GAME OVER" appears.  At any time during the game, the player sees how many coins he has collected.
